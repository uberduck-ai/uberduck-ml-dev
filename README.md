[**Uberduck**](https://uberduck.ai/) is a tool for fun and creativity with neural text-to-speech. This repository will get you creating your own speech synthesis models. Please see our [**training**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jF-Otw2_ssEcus4ISaIZu3QDmtifUvyY) and [**synthesis**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wXWuhnw2pdfFy1L-pUzHfopW10W2GiJS) notebooks. Please reach out for help and contribute!

## Overview

The models in this repository used in production are the Tacotron2, SO-VITS-SVC, zero-shot RADTTS, and HiFi-GAN.  Training code is included for Tacotron2, RADTTS, and HiFi-GAN.  Other goodies include fill-populating inference, additional languages, and Torchmoji emotional encoding.

source activate test-env
pip install git+https://github.com/uberduck-ai/uberduck-ml-dev
```

### Installation

If you want to install on your own machine, create a virtual environment and install like 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/uberduck-ai/uberduck-ml-dev.git
```

### Training

Please see the tests subfolder for examples of up to date training and inference invocation.

## Development
