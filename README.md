## Summary

![Summary](https://github.com/uberduck-ai/uberduck-ml-dev/blob/master/analytics/dependencies/details.png)

## Installation

If you want to install on your own machine, create a virtual environment and install like 

```bash
conda create -n 'test-env' python=3.10 -y
source activate test-env
pip install git+https://github.com/uberduck-ai/uberduck-ml-dev
```

## Training

Train a radtts on LJ Speech as follows

```
cd tutorials/radtts
bash download.sh
bash train.sh
```

You will need to adjust the paths and potentially other training settings in `tutorials/radtts/demo_config.json`.
This code has been tested on a single T4 as well as 2 A6000s.

For processing of new datasets, see `tutorials/radtts/radtts_data_processing.ipynb`.
